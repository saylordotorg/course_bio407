**Unit 2: Innate Immunity** <span id="2"></span> 
**In order to understand the processes of the immune system, you must
first understand how infection occurs.  Infections begin where the
inside of us has contact with the outside world. Individuals can acquire
an infection via an airway, the skin, the digestive tract, or the
reproductive tract.  Our innate immunity thus naturally begins in those
areas.  Our first line of defense is the skin, which is an impenetrable
barrier to almost all foreign invaders.  Infections often begin with a
break in the skin.  We can also ingest or inhale an infectious agent or
acquire it through sexual contact.  Innate defenses, however, are not
just skin deep; we have many strong internal innate defenses as well. 
Do remember, however, that since the innate immune system is
non-specific, it reacts in the same way to every type of foreign
invader.  Also remember that the innate response is available instantly
but does not improve with a repeat infection with the same organism, as
there is no memory in the innate immune system.**

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Recognize the cells and molecules involved in the innate immune
    response.
-   Answer questions about the complement pathway (initiators, triggers,
    early and late response, major molecules, and cells).
-   Answer questions about the roles of receptors and molecules/cells
    involved in induced responses.

*Note: The general name now used for all the receptors of the innate
immune system that recognize patterns on pathogens is pattern
recognition receptors (PRR).  PRR include TLRs, mannan binding lectin,
the chemotactic receptors, among others. The innate immune system,
although not specific for the pathogen, recognizes patterns that occur
in many pathogens to differentiate non-self from self. Please review the
last five slides of Dr. Jennifer Nyland’s "Innate Immune Response”
lecture to begin your studies of the receptors of the innate immune
response.*
