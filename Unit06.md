**Unit 6: Adaptive Immunity** <span id="6"></span> 
**Adaptive immunity is our last and most potent line of defense.  If it
fails, we will inevitably succumb to infection.  Much of adaptive
immunity relies upon two main processes: antibody production and
cytotoxic cells.  If a given pathogen is so destructive that it requires
the activation of adaptive immunity, it is important that our bodies
remember it and are capable of recognizing it in case of future attack. 
For this reason, we have memory cells that “remember” the same pathogen
and, should that pathogen invade again, are able to mount a much faster
defense against it.  Vaccines make use of this memory process in order
to provide us with protection against many infections that we might not
otherwise successfully fight.  **
