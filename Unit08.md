**Unit 8: Regulation of Immune Response** <span id="8"></span> 
**This last unit will cover the major methods that scientists and
researchers use to manipulate the immune system in our favor, including
vaccination (to boost immune responses) and immunosuppression (to temper
immune responses to allergens or transplantations).  We will also
discuss the development of new treatments that promise to direct our
immune system to recognize and attack tumor cells.**

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 6 hours to complete.
☐    Unit 8 Introduction

☐    Subunits 8.1 - 8.2: 1 hour

☐    Subunit 8.3: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 8.4: 2.5 hours

☐    Unit 8 Assessment: 0.5 hours

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Demonstrate an understanding of the ways in which medical
    professionals use their understanding of the immune system to help
    fight disease.
-   Distinguish between those means that involve immunosuppression and
    those that involve a boosting of the immune system.
-   Explain how and why various cells/molecules of the immune system can
    be used to combat cancers.
