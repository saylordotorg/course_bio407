**Unit 5: Cell Signaling and Maturation** <span id="5"></span> 
**The immune system (especially the adaptive immune system) relies upon
many distinct pathways of communication all acting in synergy.  This
unit will introduce the signaling processes that occur immediately after
antigen recognition in order to initiate adaptive immunity.*  
  
 *The adaptive immune system relies not only on signaling, but also on
cells’ ability to recognize and respond to an extraordinary number of
different kinds of pathogens.  The body is able to produce cells that
recognize a vast number of foreign objects through the process of
lymphocyte maturation.  Most biologists explain this process through the
clonal selection theory (covered in the reading for subunit 1.2 and
revisited in this unit).  Although there are alternative explanations
for the process of lymphocyte maturation, this unit will focus on the
clonal selection theory to explain this phenomenon.   **
