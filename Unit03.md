**Unit 3: Immunoglobulins** <span id="3"></span> 
**Units 1 and 2 introduced you to many of the important components of
the immune system, but some molecules, such as immunoglobulins, require
more in-depth investigation.  Immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies)
are critical to the immune response.  They bind to antigens and to
various other immune-system molecules in order to stimulate defensive
function.  All immunoglobulins have the same general, Y-shaped
structure, but they can vary in aspects of their structure and
function.  There are five classes, or isotypes, of immunoglobulins, and
each plays a different role in the immune system.  This unit will cover
the general structure and function of immunoglobulins as well as the
more specific roles of each class of immunoglobulins. It will also
address the genetic mechanisms that help create the wide diversity of
immunoglobulin types. **

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 4.66 hours to complete.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Demonstrate an understanding of the structure of immunoglobulins,
    including distinguishing between the roles of the light and heavy
    chains.
-   Distinguish between Ig classes in terms of their locations,
    behaviors, and major immune roles.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the processes of DNA rearrangement
    that allow for the diversity of antibodies.

*Note: A person’s immune repertoire refers to all of the different
antigens that the person can react to. From the first lessons you might
recall that there is exquisite specificity in each reaction. There is an
enormous number of different reactions, perhaps 10 <sup>11</sup>, or
more. How can this be when only about 20,000 genes make up the human
genome?  The readings in this section answer this question. By the way,
when there is an antigen that you don’t respond to, it is called a hole
in your repertoire.*
