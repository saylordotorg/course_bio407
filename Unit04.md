**Unit 4: Antigen Presentation** <span id="4"></span> 
*The immune system can combat individual threats, but in order to do so,
it must be able to identify these threats.  Immunogenicity, that is,
whether a compound causes an immune response or not, is related to how
foreign the compound is, as well as its molecular weight, complexity,
chemical composition, and physical form. In general, the more foreign,
the more immunogenic a compound is. Compounds of larger molecular weight
are more immunogenic. Because complexity increases immunogenicity,
homopolymers are unlikely to be immunogenic. In terms of composition,
proteins are more immunogenic than carbohydrates while lipids and
nucleic acids are rarely immunogenic. In terms of physical form,
particulates are more immunogenic than soluble compounds while denatured
compounds are more immunogenic than native structures. Immunogenicity is
also influenced by how much of a compound enters the body and the manner
in which it enters.  
  
 B cells can recognize soluble antigens, but T cells only react to
antigens presented to them. Antigen presentation is the process through
which immune system cells (such as dendritic cells, B cells and
macrophages) identify antigens and “present” them to T cells in a form
that T cells can recognize.  Once antigens have been presented, the T
cells can begin to eliminate these invaders from the body.  This unit
will cover how antigens are recognized by immune-system cells and
presented to T cells.*

    and use this information to identify levels of immunogenicity
    associated with different molecules.

    B and T-cell recognition.
-   Answer questions, in some detail, about the pathways of antigen
    presentation of MHC I and II.

*Note: An epitope is the portion of the immunogen that binds with the
antibody molecule, the part that fits in the paratope of the antibody.
Conformation is often found to be important in the recognition of an
epitope by an antibody molecule because an antibody can react to
soluble, unprocessed antigens. *

**4.2.2 Recognition by T Cells** <span id="4.2.2"></span> 
*Note: T cells recognize antigens as peptides presented in the major
histocompatibility molecules on the surface of an antigen-presenting
cell. These molecules were termed major histocompatibility for their
discovery during transplantation reactions, so the name comes from the
major role of these molecules in tissue (histo) compatibility. CD8+ T
cells (cytotoxic T cells) recognize antigens presented by antigen
presenting cells in MHC Class I molecules, and CD4+ T cells (helper T
cells) recognize antigens presented in MHC Class II molecules.  The CD4
molecule binds to the MHC Class II molecule and the CD8 molecule binds
to the MHC Class I molecule. These are required co-receptors of the
interaction. MHC Class I molecules are on all nucleated cells in our
body, whereas MHC Class II molecules are on antigen-presenting cells.
Because of the requirement for antigen-presenting cell presentation, T
cells recognize processed antigens.  
    
 The T cell receptors of most T cells are composed of an alpha chain and
a beta chain. A small set of T cells have T cell receptors that have
gamma delta chains. Unlike immunoglobulin, the B cell receptor, T cell
receptors are not secreted. *

     *Note: It is important to keep in mind that recognition of non-self
    and not self is key to understanding immunity. Recognition controls
    how an MHC Class I or MHC Class II molecule is loaded with the
    peptides that will be presented to T cells. While Class I molecules
    present antigens on the surface of the infected cells (endogenous
    antigens), Class II molecules present antigens taken up by
    phagocytosis. The method that loads Class I molecules is critically
    different from the method which loads Class II molecules.  helps  *
