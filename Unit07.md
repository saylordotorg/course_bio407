**Unit 7: Failures of the Immune System** <span id="7"></span> 
**Even as the human immune system has evolved and developed complex
defensive mechanisms against pathogens, pathogens themselves have
evolved and developed new means of evading the immune system.  In some
cases, the adaptations of pathogens are such that they are extremely
infectious, virulent, and sometimes even fatal.   
  
 We are also threatened by health hazards posed by our own immune
system.  The immune system can, for example, respond inappropriately to
its own cells (as in the case of autoimmune diseases) or to innocuous
foreign cells (as in the case of allergies and other hypersensitivity
diseases).  This unit will cover some clinical and medical aspects of
the immune system as it relates to immune-system dysfunction. **

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 5 hours to complete.
☐    Unit 7 Introduction

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Demonstrate an understanding of the ways in which pathogens overcome
    host defenses.
-   Distinguish between the processes of inherited and acquired
    immunodeficiency.
-   Answer specific questions about the consequences of these failures
    of the immune system.
