**Unit 1: An Introduction to the Immune System** <span id="1"></span> 
**In this first unit, we will cover the core concepts of immunology and
identify the components of the innate (non-specific) and adaptive
(specific) immune systems.**  

**Both the innate and the adaptive immune systems help distinguish
between what is “self” and what is “non-self” and subsequently protect
against non-self.  Although this is an easy statement to say and read,
stop for a moment and think of the complexity of this feat.  It takes so
many different molecules to make you, and so many other molecules are on
potential pathogens, how does the immune system know the difference, and
react quickly enough to protect you? That question will be answered
throughout this course. **

**The innate immune system is available quickly and thus it is the first
line of defense.  However, the innate immune system recognizes general
patterns in pathogens so it is not specific for the individual pathogen.
In addition, the innate immune response has no memory so there is no
improvement in the innate immune response with repeat infection with the
same pathogen.  The adaptive immune response takes time to respond, it
is specific to the pathogen, it has memory so the subsequent response to
the same pathogen occurs more quickly and is greater in magnitude.   In
this unit, you will be introduced to the cells, proteins, structures and
fluids involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses.**

    system.
-   Recognize a few fundamental experiments/discoveries in immunology
    (Jenner’s work on vaccines, Pasteur’s with rabies and cholera,
    Koch’s work on microbes).
-   Recognize different immune-system cells: their place of

     *Note: The inflammatory response and innate immunity is the first
    line of defense, but its role extends to helping begin the adaptive
    immune response as well.  The hallmarks of inflammation are redness,
    heat, pain, and swelling. These hallmarks are due to the actions of
    the chemicals and cells of the innate immune system which will
    briefly be described here. The adaptive immune response is further
    separated into humoral and cellular immunity. *

    *Humoral immunity originates with the term humours which means body
    fluid, however the term humoral immunity is generally used to
    describe the adaptive immune response that occurs in the fluid of
    the blood, which more simply put, is antibody based immunity.
    Cell-mediated immunity is defense specifically created by the direct
    actions of immune T cells. Theories are available concerning how
    lymphocytes can respond to many different antigens  how specific
    responss are initiated when needed, and how reaction with
    self-antigens is prevented were developed and tested in experiments
    that illuminated these important and elegant traits. The theories
    began with Burnet’s clonal selection theory, and were advanced with
    Medawar’s understanding of tolerance to self, and then final
    elucidation of these traits came with Tonegawa’s data concerning the
    inheritance of immunoglobulin genes as gene segments that recombined
    to form the intact gene. These theories and data are described in
    this chapter and will help you realize what a remarkable system
    protects you.*
